# CLAUDE.md — Minilab Platform
<!-- Version: V43 in_flight · 2026-04-22 -->
<!-- THIS IS THE ONLY FILE READ AT STARTUP. Everything else is lazy-loaded via the Router. -->

---

## §1 · What Is Minilab

Minilab (minilab.my) — AI-powered ERP SaaS for the entire Malaysian strata property management industry.
Stack: Next.js 15 App Router · TypeScript strict · Supabase PostgreSQL · Vercel · Tailwind v3 + shadcn/ui
DB: Supabase project `nncbsumdmsyjjrgdjjea` (Singapore region)
Serves: JMB/MC buildings, PMC, security, cleaning, contractor, supplier/store, developer, residents across portfolio-scale operations. NOT a single-building tool.

---

## §2 · Session Protocol

FETCH LIVE STATE (every new session): GET https://minilab.my/api/bibble/state — returns current V-number, latest D, counts, all pending tasks with scenarios + remarks. This is the single source of truth for "what's going on." Report §7 version, latest D, top 3 pending tasks before first answer.

1. Fetch /api/bibble/state (above) — report version + top 3 pending tasks
2. Read THIS file (CLAUDE.md) — nothing else yet
3. Run: git log --oneline -10 && git status
4. Check §4 Router below — identify which docs (if any) your task needs
5. Extract only the relevant sections using awk (see §3)
6. Do the work
7. Run Closing Block (§6)

---

## §3 · How To Read Docs (awk, never cat)

Every lazy-loaded doc uses `## §Anchor-Name` headers as semantic markers.

Extract a section (up to the next anchor):

    awk '/^## §Face-Recognition/,/^## §/' docs/startup/recent-decisions.md | head -n -1

List all anchors in a file:

    grep '^## §' docs/startup/recent-decisions.md

Extract a table section from schema:

    awk '/^## §Table-attendance_logs/,/^## §/' docs/startup/actual-schema-columns.md | head -n -1

Rules:
- NEVER cat a full doc over 50 lines. Always awk the section you need.
- If you don't know which anchor to use, grep '^## §' first to see the index.
- If a doc has no anchors yet, read it fully ONCE, then add anchors as part of your closing block.
- Anchors are semantic — they never break when content is added/removed (unlike line numbers).

---

## §4 · Bible Router

Match your task to a row. Read only what's listed. If no row matches, you probably don't need extra docs.

### Schema & Database

| Task | File | Anchor |
|------|------|--------|
| New migration / new table | actual-schema-columns.md | §Table-{name} for related tables |
| Alter column on existing table | actual-schema-columns.md | §Table-{name} |
| Check if column/table exists | actual-schema-columns.md | §Table-{name} |
| New RPC function | actual-schema-columns.md | §RPCs |
| New env var needed | env-required.md | Full file OK (small, ~7KB) |

## §5 · Hard Rules (always in memory — never violate)

Billing: JMB/MC always free (no trial, no subscription). Service providers pay per-staff + unit-tier + credit packs. All pricing in billing_config table (superadmin editable, zero hardcoded values).

Hardware Store: NO inventory system. Telegram orders → invoice billing only.

Technician: A building staff member (role=staff, position=Technician), NOT a contractor_worker.

Face: face-api.js + pgvector, 128-dim descriptors, cosine similarity threshold 0.6, match_face() RPC. No manual clock-in ever. Face IS identity — no name dropdown. One photo = one enrollment (autoEnrollFace utility). No separate FaceEnrollModal.

Attendance: Unlimited in/out pairs per day. Late/early/OT calculated from building_working_hours.

Portal routing: Permanent, locked, via lib/auth/get-portal-path.ts. NEVER duplicate this logic anywhere.
- Building staff phone → /app · BM/admin PC → /bm/dashboard
- Guard/cleaner/tech PC → /app · Committee phone → /app PC → /committee/dashboard
- Resident → /resident always · Store = Supplier (same portal)
- ORG admins → their desktop portal always

Resident auth: Residents authenticate ONLY via WhatsApp Reverse OTP. Never Telegram, never Google OAuth, never email/password. Any code path that lets a resident in via another channel is a bible violation.

Google OAuth scope: Google OAuth is ORG-only — for service provider organizations (security, cleaning, developer, supplier, store admins). Never for residents or building staff. The Google callback MUST reject users without an org role.

Resident PWA device tracking: The resident PWA does NOT track devices. No last_active timestamps, no device_info, no session history. Device tracking is staff/guard/cleaner/kiosk only. `resident_pwa_sessions` was scaffolded but never wired — it is being dropped in V37.

PWA API routes: Use getSession() not requirePermission().

Identity-shaped UI fields default to building scope: Signatures, names, avatars, and other "whose voice is this reply?" fields default to building-scoped rows with personalization tokens (e.g. `{{staff_name}}`), not per-user rows — unless there's a hard compliance requirement for per-user. Per-user fields of this shape become targets for shared-session cross-writes (D-0828 shipped per-user `users.email_signature`; when Asha logged in on HZH's front-desk PC her edits overwrote HZH's row — V41-S7 / D-0832 reverted to `buildings.email_footer_template`).

Types: NEVER modify database.types.ts manually — regenerate:
npx supabase gen types typescript --project-id nncbsumdmsyjjrgdjjea

RPC Caller Rule: When ANY RPC signature changes → grep -r ".rpc('function_name')" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" → update ALL callers in same commit → NOTIFY pgrst 'reload schema'.

TypeScript discipline: `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors` MUST stay false (or absent) in next.config.js. New TS errors must be fixed before commit. If genuinely unavoidable, use `@ts-expect-error` with a comment explaining why. NEVER `@ts-ignore`. NEVER `as any` (except `.from()` on tables not yet in generated types — always with `@ts-expect-error` noting which table and why). NEVER non-null `!` assertions without a prior null check in the same scope.
Before any commit: `npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -c "error TS"` → must return 0. V32d removed ignoreBuildErrors after clearing 108 errors — ZERO errors is the permanent baseline.

Migration discipline: Every migration file MUST be applied to prod in the same session it is created. Verify immediately after apply:
  SELECT name FROM supabase_migrations.schema_migrations WHERE name LIKE '{number}%';
If migration contains CREATE POLICY without IF NOT EXISTS, note in closing block that re-execution is unsafe (register-only on re-apply). Closing block MUST confirm migration applied, not just file created.

PMC endpoint rule: All /api/bm/* handlers that call requirePermission() MUST pass req as second arg. check-api-permission.ts throws in dev if PMC session detected without req. Enforced since D-0730. No exceptions within /api/bm/* except /billing/* and /settings/danger/* (those don't use requirePermission at all).

Git: Push to main only. One task = one commit + push. No branches. If push fails: git pull --rebase origin main && git push origin main.

Infra:
- Telethon microservice: GCP e2-micro 34.42.210.102:8443
- R2 bucket: minilab-media · public URL: https://media.minilab.my · Account ID: 585f5b927632127fe9545602c82c0b09
- Sentry: gated on SENTRY_DSN env var
- Vercel Hobby: 1 daily cron only (/api/cron/daily) · Deploy via Deploy Hook (Vercel webhook broken)
- Face models: /api/models/face-api/
- Service provider registration: Google OAuth + email/password

Visitor pre-registration — dual path: Residents have two ways to pre-register a visitor:
1. Invite link (primary) — resident generates a link → shares to visitor → visitor self-registers IC + plate + photo → gets QR
2. Fill in details (legacy) — resident enters all visitor info → gets QR to share
Both paths coexist. Do not remove either. AI defaults to the invite-link path.

Visitor self-registration requirements: Form requires IC photo (mandatory, always), vehicle plate (mandatory unless "no vehicle" flag set), visitor name + IC number (text, mandatory). Unit_id is server-locked from the invite record — visitor cannot choose or change the unit.

Invite TTL: Per-building, configurable via BM Settings → Apps & Access (2–168 hours). Platform default 24h. Cron marks pending invites past `expires_at` as `status='expired'` daily.

Visitor status lifecycle:
- `visitor_invites.status`: `pending` → (`submitted` | `cancelled` | `expired`)
- `visitors.status`: `active` → (`checked_in` → `checked_out` | `expired`)
Guard check-in MUST set `status='checked_in'`; checkout MUST set `status='checked_out'`.

Sidebar / route permission gates must reference keys defined in lib/auth/permissions.ts PERMISSIONS catalog. Default-deny on undefined keys silently hides UI without warning (origin: V41-S4 — staff sidebar had approvals.manage ghost key, default-denied, Approvals tab invisible). If you add a new gated surface, confirm the permission string exists in the catalog before shipping. Consider startup lint to fail build on undefined keys.

Silent-infra-failure detection: when a feature fails and shares infrastructure with other features, check ALL others using the same infra. A silent failure in shared infra (embedder, classifier, vision, router, auth) is invisible until one feature makes it loud. Origin: V41-S3 — T9 capture crashed on dim mismatch; document_chunks had been 0 rows since V40-S3 across ALL KB usage, undetected because no user flow exercised retrieval until T9 tried to write.

Per-feature Save buttons live visually inside the section they save — never floating at page footer across multiple unrelated sections. A settings page with email config + SMS config + branding should have 3 Save buttons, each inside its own card. Origin: V41 — Asha's signature confusion: one footer Save saved all sections at once, edits to wrong field were ambiguously attributed to the visible save action.

DashScope text-embedding-v3 native dim = 1024. Compatible-mode supports {512, 768, 1024} only. NEVER use 1536 (that's OpenAI text-embedding-3-small, different provider). All pgvector columns on embedding-producing tables are vector(1024). All HNSW indexes are ops=vector_cosine_ops. Origin: V41-S3g — document_chunks + bm_reply_exemplars + media_search_index migrated from 1536→1024 in migration 118.

Migration idempotency: All future migrations must be idempotent. Use CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS, CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS, DROP POLICY IF EXISTS before every CREATE POLICY, DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS before every CREATE TRIGGER. Re-running any migration file must never fail or leave the DB in a partial state. Origin: V43-D7-hotfix — migration 124 had bare CREATE POLICY with no drop-guard; idempotency added as source-file patch without re-applying.

Image CORS — R2 rendering vs pixel-read: Never add crossOrigin="anonymous" to <img> tags used purely for rendering (avatars, thumbnails, document previews) — R2's current CORS config causes rendering to fail. Client-side code that needs to read pixel data from an R2 image (face-api.js, canvas export, cropping) must (a) append a cache-bust query param like ?_cb=<timestamp> to force a fresh network request, AND (b) set crossOrigin="anonymous" on the <img> it constructs in code — NOT on any shared rendering tag. The cache-bust prevents browser from serving a tainted non-CORS cache entry; the in-code crossOrigin enables canvas pixel access. Origin: V43-N1-hotfix (D-0858) diagnosed cache taint; V43-N1-hotfix-2 (D-0859) corrected the rule after rendering-tag crossOrigin caused R2 to return access-control-allow-origin: null → broken avatars across /bm/staff/all, /bm/cases, and attendance kiosk.

## §6 · Closing Block (every session end — no exceptions)

1. DECISIONS: Append to docs/startup/recent-decisions.md under the correct §Feature-Area anchor. Use next D-XXXX number. If no anchor exists for this feature, CREATE one.
2. SCHEMA: If any table/column changed → update docs/startup/actual-schema-columns.md. Update the relevant §Table-{name} section. If new table → add new §Table-{name} section.
3. ENV: If new env var → update docs/startup/env-required.md
4. NEW TABLE CHECKLIST: Create ai_view_ for it, add to generic_read allowlist, add keywords to ai_tools.
5. ROUTER: If this session introduced a new feature area or pattern → add a row to §4 Router in THIS file.
6. STATE: Update §7 Current State below (version, counts, pending items).
7. GRAPH: If major architectural change → update docs/startup/graph-report.md.
8. LIST files changed.
9. COMMIT with prefix (feat: | fix: | docs: | refactor: | chore:) and push to main.
10. SYNC BIBLE: automatic via .husky/pre-push on git push. Ensure bible §7 Current State is updated when counts change (version, tables, pages, routes, decisions).
11. BIBBLE SYNC (MANDATORY — fails silently, so verify): For every bibble task touched this session, call upsertBibbleRemark(taskId, body) from lib/bibble/log.ts. For any new task surfaced, call createBibbleTask(...). Session close MUST update bibble_meta rows: version, version_status, latest_d, open_priorities. Use supabaseAdmin directly — no API hop. If task IDs are unclear, query: SELECT id, title, session FROM bibble_tasks WHERE status IN ('READY','IN_PROGRESS','RECON_NEEDED') ORDER BY session, display_order;

## §7 · Current State

Version: V43 in_flight · V42 in_flight · V41 closed 2026-04-21
Database: 188 tables · migrations 001-126
Pages: 350 · API routes: 610 · Decisions: D-0865 latest · Portals: 17+
Live task board: /bibble · State API: /api/bibble/state · Raw docs: /bibble/raw/*.md · Doc manifest: /api/bibble/docs
V43-D8-S1a shipped D-0864 — push infra: web-push, SW handlers, usePushSubscription hook, /api/push POST+DELETE+PATCH, 3 event wires, migration 126.
V43-D8-S1b shipped D-0865 — resident card grid landing (/resident server component, ResidentCardGrid, dark premium 1-per-row), /resident/settings push prefs (ResidentSettingsClient, per-category toggles). task_d8_pwa_push=DONE. S2 READY.
V43-N1 shipped D-0856, D-0857 (2 decisions) — blocking face enrollment on all 3 upload paths + BM face backfill tool; shift-lead flag + bulk attendance clock-in by shift lead; migration 125; "via {name}" badge on BM attendance tab.
V43-N1-hotfix shipped D-0858 — cache-bust in FaceBackfillButton; crossOrigin on rendering tags (reverted in hotfix-2).
V43-N1-hotfix-2 shipped D-0859 — revert rendering-tag crossOrigin (broke avatars); correct §5 Image CORS rule.

V42 in flight — ALL priorities, scenarios, remarks live at /bibble. This §7 no longer tracks pending items (moved to bibble_tasks table per D-0834). Historical session summaries preserved below for context.

V41-S7 shipped D-0832, D-0833 (2 decisions) — per-user email signature (D-0828) replaced with building-level email footer template. Migration 120 drops `users.email_signature*`, adds `buildings.email_footer_template` + `buildings.email_footer_enabled`. Console prefill interpolates `{{staff_name}}` from session full_name — fixes cross-user write bug (Asha writing into HZH's row on shared front-desk PC). UI: new "Email Footer" card at /bm/settings/email with live preview of interpolated output.

V41-S4 shipped D-0827 through D-0829 (3 decisions) — BM console email reply unblocked at CHV: channel-aware send guard (D-0827) + per-user email signature with auto-prefill into console compose (D-0828, migration 119, **superseded by V41-S7 / migration 120**) + /bm/settings/email layout left-aligned full-width (D-0829).

V37 shipped D-0755 through D-0768 (14 decisions) — full visitor pre-registration feature + major platform hardening cycle.

V37 accomplishments:
- D-0755/D-0756: Resident PWA audit + wide platform recon (identified 11 P0/P1 items)
- D-0757/D-0758: B3 instrumentation verified; logActions FK + ai_processed semantic fixed
- D-0759: Bible §5 hardened + 6 platform fixes (SW prefixes, middleware redirect, dashboardForRole removal, approvals catch, resident_pwa_sessions dropped)
- D-0760: Google OAuth ORG-only · handleLoginOTP resident-only + hard-scoped · ContextSwitcher in /app
- D-0761-D-0766: Visitor pre-registration feature — schema (migrations 109, 110), resident API + PWA UI, public /v/[token] page + visitor self-reg API + upload, cron expiry + BM TTL settings, AI tool swap to create_visitor_invite
- D-0767/D-0768: Nudge bugs recon + blocked investigation (compose/nudge target displayed contact — handed to V38-S1)

3 new permanent rules added to bible §5 this cycle (D-0759):
- Residents authenticate via WhatsApp Reverse OTP only (never Telegram, never Google, never email/password)
- Google OAuth is ORG-only (never residents or staff)
- Resident PWA does NOT track devices

Visitor pre-reg rules added (D-0765):
- Dual-path (invite link primary, legacy fallback — both preserved)
- Self-reg requires IC photo + vehicle plate (or no-vehicle flag)
- Unit server-locked from invite record
- Invite TTL per-building configurable 2-168h, default 24h
- Status lifecycle (pending→submitted/cancelled/expired for invites; active→checked_in→checked_out for visitors)

V38 shipped D-0771 through D-0780 (7 decisions + 1 recon + 1 audit) — BM console correctness, WA delivery observability, VMS checkout unblock, AI message status normalization.

V38 accomplishments:
- D-0771 (V38-S2): VMS checkout CHECK constraint extended to 'checked_out' + UI error surfacing — 935 stuck visitors unblocked
- D-0772 (V38-S1): Console send/nudge/compose target displayed contact in contact view (resolveTarget helper introduced)
- D-0774 (V38-S3): WA delivery webhook wired — statuses[] now processed, new columns delivered_at/read_at/failed_at/delivery_error/delivery_error_code, wa_delivered/wa_read/delivery_failed lifecycle, avg 1.56s delivery signal
- D-0775 (V38-S1b): Nudge internal log card persists against correct thread in contact view; resident_id surfaced on ContactListItem
- D-0778 (V38-S6): delivery_failed surfaced in console timeline — window_closed reuses 24h nudge banner, other failures get expandable dev-details card with copy-to-clipboard, one-click retry via new /api/bm/console/retry endpoint (classifyDeliveryFailure helper)
- D-0779 (V38-S5): Silent delivery failures fixed — deliveryError now captured in all failure branches across direct-message + send + retry routes (deliveryFailedPatch helper)
- D-0780 (V38-S7): AI message status normalized from 'complete' to 'delivered'; messages.status DB default dropped; 1,694 historical rows backfilled; 8 other insert sites made explicit

Three new class-killing helpers this cycle:
- lib/messaging/resolveTarget (or equivalent per page.tsx) — view-aware recipient resolution
- lib/messaging/classify-delivery-failure — failure category single source of truth
- lib/messaging/delivery-failed-patch — DB update shape for failed sends

V39 shipped D-0781 through D-0788 (8 decisions) — WhatsApp AI audit + Jarvis infrastructure recon + strategy handover. Discovery session, no code changes.

V39 accomplishments:
- D-0781: WhatsApp /ai-activity audit — 22 issues across 9 categories identified (silent drops, unimplemented handlers, enum hallucination, latency, DeepSeek bypass)
- D-0782: Jarvis infrastructure recon — RAG framework fully built but dormant (document_chunks 0 rows across all buildings)
- D-0783: Framing rule locked — Jarvis for Building is north star; deletion of tool surfaces as a fix is forbidden
- D-0784: /ai-activity page confirmed public by design (intentional operational trade-off, no auth gate)
- D-0785: KB architecture decided — user-defined free-form sections + entries (text or doc upload); schema choice pending V40 Opus validation
- D-0786: create_legal_signal_case orphan handler to be deleted in V40 hygiene batch
- D-0787: 11 write-action handlers deferred to V40+; get_payment_instructions (thin) brought to V39 execution
- D-0788: Session bootstrap system established — MINILAB-BOOTSTRAP.md + V39-HANDOVER.md (saved locally by Max)

V40-S1 shipped D-0789 (1 decision) — WA webhook + admin pipeline silent-drop instrumentation.
V40-S3 shipped D-0790 through D-0793 (4 decisions) — KB infrastructure + MOA schema + OpenAI purge.
V40-S5 shipped D-0796 through D-0799 (4 decisions) — MOA toggle UI + plate/card intents + approvals extension.
V40-S6 shipped D-0800 through D-0806 (7 decisions) — hygiene batch: enum validation, thin handlers, credential vault, orphan delete, synthetic intent doc, console guard.
V40-S7 shipped D-0807 through D-0808 (2 decisions) — building_working_hours in §3 + KB pre-fetcher for 3 intents.
V40-S8 shipped D-0809 through D-0814 (6 decisions) — guard/cleaner/task/resident/timeline/listing handlers + 8 dead handlers removed.
V40-S7b shipped D-0815 through D-0818 (4 decisions) — incidents + cleaning complaints UI on VMS + Guard PWA + Cleaner PWA.

V40-S3 accomplishments:
- D-0793: OpenAI embedder purged — lib/documents/embedder.ts fully rewritten to DashScope text-embedding-v3; platform single-vendor
- D-0792: unit_vehicles + unit_access_cards tables + buildings.is_moa_active (migration 114)
- D-0791: MOA task queue architecture decision — reuses approvals table, approval_type extends in S5
- D-0790: building_kb_entries table + lib/kb/indexer.ts + BM KB CRUD API (5 routes) + ai_view_kb + document_chunks.kb_entry_id link-back

V40-S6 accomplishments:
- D-0800: createCase enum validation + 28-entry coercion map; unknown values fall to 'other'; DB never rejects silently
- D-0801: get_payment_instructions thin handler reads building_payment_settings (actual columns); closes 1 weekly CHV failure
- D-0802: find_open_case thin handler; lookup by case_number or resident_id; closes 2 weekly COMPLAINT_FOLLOWUP failures
- D-0803: DEEPSEEK_API_KEY moved from process.env to credential vault in column-mapper.ts + auto-register.ts
- D-0804: create_legal_signal_case orphan handler deleted (confirmed zero callers)
- D-0805: ADMIN_COMMAND synthetic intent documented in INTENT_DEFINITIONS for audit completeness
- D-0806: resolveTarget null-phone warn + handleSend early-return toast; silent null-send drops closed

V40-S8 shipped D-0809 through D-0814 (6 decisions) — guard/cleaner/task/resident/timeline/listing handlers + 8 dead handlers removed.
V40-T9 shipped D-0819 through D-0822 (4 decisions) — adoptive learning: bm_reply_exemplars capture + retrieval + §4.6 injection.
V41-S3d shipped D-0823 (1 decision) — DashScope endpoint → intl region (Singapore API key accepted).
V41-S3f shipped D-0824 (1 decision, reverted) — T9-TRACE diagnostic logs (removed in S3g).
V41-S3g shipped D-0825 (1 decision) — DashScope native dim 1024 fix: migration 118 (3 columns + 5 indexes + 2 RPCs), embedder.ts 1536→1024, T9 traces stripped, bm.ts dead generateEmbedding deleted.

V40 EXECUTION PENDING (remaining after T9):

- T8: Seed CHV KB manually via new UI (Max + BM Hoe Zee How — payment details, house rules, facility rules, emergency contacts, committee decisions).
- T12: End-to-end verification — resident asks KB-answerable question, confirm retrieval fires and answer is grounded. Confirm BM reply captures into bm_reply_exemplars.

Pre-existing pending (carried forward):
- WA UI tick truth + rename 'delivered' → 'sent' (V38-S4 deferred — needs more webhook data)
- 24h window pre-send block (prevent 131047 instead of surfacing it post-fail)
- 887 stale 'active' visitors at CHV — daily cron flips active → expired after 24h
- A1 AI audit rules engine (blocked on R1 traffic volume)
- FIX-1B resolveUser silent 'bm' default hardening
- V32b VMS floor-3 blindspot (S4-S7 guards) — blocked on device screenshot
- V32c GQ ground-floor notation normalizer (fold into V32b)
- Guard fraud detection (defaulters + random-number guards)
- building_payment_settings duplicate table audit
- Haiku 4.5 model migration — may now have enough CHV traffic for evidence
- WA/TG automated sender filter (B4 was email-only)
- Dead code cleanup (composeVisitorArrivalMessage, VISITOR_TYPE_PHRASE, PURPOSE_TO_CATEGORY in send.ts — orphaned after D-0754)
- Compose bar recipient selector UI polish (beyond V38-S1 fix)
- Committee login UX decision
- Expected-visitors-today view for guards
- arrival notify + invite-submitted notify (blocked on PWA push infra)
- PWA push infrastructure — web-push install → VAPID → SW handler → subscribe UI → notifyVisitorArrivalPwa

Deferred to V40+:
- 9 missing write-action handlers (send_emergency_broadcast, notify_supplier, notify_contractors, notify_agencies, request_photo, charge_listing_fee, assign_contractor, set_recurrence, notify_resident, get_case_timeline) — see D-0787; find_open_case + get_payment_instructions now done (D-0801/D-0802)
- Resident pipeline unification with ai_tools table (architectural, separate design session)
- media_search_index activation (ingestion pipeline for image-based KB)
- voice_knowledge_base redesign (currently platform-wide, needs building_id scope)

Blocked on Max:
- CHV staff walkthrough with BM Hoe Zee How — record vendor workflows, identify access card / car plate vendor names
- DISABLE_DEV_LOGIN=true on Vercel
- E2E test with Seeteng at Lumi Residency
- MOA Phase 2 build (MOA-SPEC.md complete, Node.js + Playwright VPS agent targeting Advelsoft HTML5 RDP)
- Superadmin PDPA deletion workflow
- BM staff page dropdown transparency bug
- CHV collection accounts setup

Key contacts: Seeteng (Lumi test user), Hoe Zee How (CHV BM, 712 units, AI active)
